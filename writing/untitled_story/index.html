	<h1>Untitled Story (age 5)</h1>

	<!-- content -->

	<p><i>I found this story that I wrote at age 5. I thought it was hilarious so I decided to share it on my website. Enjoy!</i></p>

	<p><i>Some spelling has been corrected for readability.</i></p>

	<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

	<p>Once in a cottage it looked like the cottage was 10 ft high and all around the cottage was 20ft and it looked too small to go in and there was no door and those are the secrets.</p>

	<p>Now I want to start the story. Well, we know that there is a cottage so do you know why its so small? Well, you will find that out in other parts of the story now do you know what's inside the cottage? There is an 11 year old it was a boy and his house was too small he thought his house was too small but it was one of the biggest houses. Well, he did not know who made his house small. The night before his house was big as usual. He went down to the river bank to go swimming. He saw a boat sinking. He swam and swam for 3 hours. Then he go to an island. He went on the island. There was a tree. He cut the tree up and then he said hmmmmm... and thought. He had a backpack. He took all his stuff out and found lots of rope. He tied all of the cut up logs. He made a raft. He packed up his backpack. So he put his raft on the water. He quickly went on the raft. He drowned.</p>

	<h2>Chapter 2: Under Water</h2>

	<p>He wanted to be back. Or to the other side... Then like magik everything was white... even him then suddenly again. He was on the other side... It started to rain. He wanted to go back to his house. He had an idea. He went in the magik sea. You know the magik sea is the place that turned white. He wanted to go home... Then he was in his house sitting on a chair next to a nice hot fire. It was 9:00 PM... 2-3 minutes later he drifted to sleep even without eating dinner... He slept for 11 hours. Honk shoo honk shoo he went. He woke up he listening. BOOM a big rock fell from the ceiling... He thought like he was dreaming but he was not, a stair case appeared. He waited and then went up the stair case...</p>

	<h2>Chapter 3: The Stair Case</h2>

	<p>He stood up and walked towards the stair case and went up... He saw the most beautiful thing ever seen... Gold jewels and diamonds, his eyes grew he was rich. This was a poor world he even had not seen a penny before. Jewelry and other fragile things... It was like a celebration! Nobody in those times had seen that much money. He could buy like? to have. Think of a thing you can't buy, he could buy it? Imagine millions of dollars.</p>

	<p>You do not want to know whats next but if you do want to know whats next keep reading on.</p>

	<p>He saw a rock he did not know if it was a rock or a clock... AND THEN... He saw a hand he saw claws. That thing he thought was a rock or a clock it was an eye. He almost ran but then... A voice came it said "you have forgotten to tell the reader what your name is". Then the monster disappeared. Ok my name is... Hmmmmm... oh! ya, my name is Seer. NO its Lan and i'm rich. Do you know I have a computer well this is my password</p>
