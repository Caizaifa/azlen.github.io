I have been thinking about mnemonics in language learning. And I am struck by the fact that mnemonics do not have to be words.

Common types of Mnemonics:

* Acronym
* Sentence
* Story

A mnemonic is simply a tool for remembering. 

The trick with memory, is that the more connections you have with an idea, the more likely it is that you will remember it. When I memorize words in other languages, I will often create multiple images or mnemonics to associate with each word to heighten the chance of remembering a single one of them.

Many language learning applications these days are marketed to be quick and easy. Learn a language by practicing for just 5 minutes every day! They repeat words on a schedule based off the idea of the "forgetting curve". But this forgetting curve originated from getting people to memorize nonsense words!

If one creates the proper connections for words in their mind, they may be able to remember almost all the words they learn, weeks or months in the future without ever having to review over and over. However this has to be a slow process, you can't simply look at a word for half a second and move on. But if you spend a minute or two thinking about each word, thinking about each syllable, conjuring up a story in your imagination: you will find the memory to be much more permanent.

Mnemonics should not be constrained to simply words and phrases. Often, I remember using images or strange situations. But I like to experiment with other mnemonic techniques..

Types of mnemonics:

* Image associations with pronunciation
* Visualizing pronunciation as shape or architectural form
* Creating a story with character components (Chinese + Japanese)
* Connecting to similar sounding words that you know  
  \- Be careful because this can bring unintended meaning
*
