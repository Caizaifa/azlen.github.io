description: Experiment in teaching computer program to design business cards.

---
A series of ongoing experiments using both AI and non-AI techniques to teach design principles to a computer. I have chosen the goal of designing business cards as it seems an achievable goal. For all the complexities of design (colour, layout, fonts, visual balance, etc.), business cards have certain constraints of size and information that make the task seem more plausible.
