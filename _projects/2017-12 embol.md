description: Video game about social anxiety made for Ludum Dare 40.

Embol is a game I made about social anxiety. Made for [Ludum Dare 40](http://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40) (theme: _The more you have, the worse it is_).

The title of the game was inspired by the word [embolalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolalia) which refers to certain verbal expressions such as pause filters (e.g. "Like", "Um", "Uh") and other formulaic speech.

Embol has been my most complete and fun game I have created for Ludum Dare. I am very happy with how it turned out.

<!--UPDATE 01/09/2018: I wrote a [post-mortem](/blog/ld40_post_mortem) over on my blog about what went right, what went wrong, and what I have learned from making Embol.-->
