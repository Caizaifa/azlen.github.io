description: Combine two words into a single word that can be read as either.

---
Experiment in creating perceptual shift ambigrams, words that can be read as two different words depending on how the shape of the letters is interpereted.

Created 1200+ hand-drawn glyphs combining 2 or more letters (e.g T+F, ls+u), and coded a small web interface in which you can input your own words for it to merge.

Some examples:

Example #1: True, False

Example #2: hot, cold
