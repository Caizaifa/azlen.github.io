	<h1>Ludum Dare 40 Post-Mortem</h1>
	<i>January 19th, 2017</i>

	<!-- content -->

	<p>Five years of participating in Ludum Dare and I finally get around to writing my first post-mortem.</p>

	<p>First, let me introduce my game, <a href="/projects/embol">Embol</a>.</p>

	<p>In Embol, you play a character named Jon who has social anxiety. Words pop up around Jon's head, and you click on them to form sentences. But beware! among these words lurk "umm"s and "uhh"s, awkward filler words polluting Jon's sentences.</p>

	<img src="/projects/embol/embol.gif"></img>

	<p>I am actually quite happy about Embol, it is the most complete and fun game that I have made for Ludum Dare thus far. My main problem is that I did not have enough time to complete the story. As a result, the game is quite short with a rather abrupt ending.</p>

	<p>The theme for this Ludum Dare was "The more you have, the worse it is" <span class="grey">*</span>. I thought it would be fun to make a game about words which led to thinking about filler words like "umm" and "err". I quickly drew up some mockups on a piece of paper and set to work.</p>

	<p class="grey">* consistently for the past few Ludum Dare's, the winning theme is the one for which I have the least ideas.</p>

	<h2>Time Breakdown</h2>

	<table>
		<tr><td class="grey">graphics</td> <td>2</td><td>hours</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="grey" style="padding-right: 15px">programming</td> <td>19</td><td>hours</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="grey">sound/music</td> <td>1</td><td>hour</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="grey">story</td> <td>4</td><td>hours</td></tr>
	</table>

	<h2>What Went Right</h2>

	<ul class="padded-list">
		<li>Settled on an idea quickly. Sat down for 30 minutes brainstorming ideas, settled on one and immediately started coding.</li>
		<li>Using <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. This was my first experience with the Godot Engine and it was surprisingly easy to get started with.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What went wrong</h2>

	<ul class="padded-list">
		<li>Not enough time to work on the story. I spent way too long creating the basic functionality of the game and adding small bits of polish that I only left 4 hours to work on the story.</li>
		<li>Most of my code and story ended up in one big file, which ended up wasting a lot of time scrolling through my code.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What I learned</h2>

	<p>I feel like I learned the most from watching Twitch streamers playing my game. The initial idea of the game was to <i>avoid</i> clicking on filler words, but people really enjoyed clicking on <i>everything</i> and trying to make nonsensical sentences.</p>

	<p>If I continue with this dialogue mechanic in the future I would</p>

	<ul>
		<li>add random stupid words, imagine starting your sentence with "platypus"</li>
	</ul>
